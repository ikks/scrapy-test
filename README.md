Using scrapy to fetch some data

## TL;TR

Please do find a list of proxies so you can use this one and fill 
the  proxies.txt file with them

SCRAPY_URL_BASE='https://militancia.para.com/publico/paso-{}/{}' scrapy crawl people -o people.jl

You can customize your defaults in settings.py

If you find a nice list of proxies, please do fill an issue or a PR to let others know


With this you will learn to:

 1. Use some proxies to fetch the data
 1. Practice crawling wizard pages to extract data
 1. Recover from gaps and continue working
 1. Store the data so you can retrieve it easily afterwards
 1. Have lots of fun


## No Warranties

Use this at your own risk, no guarrantee or anything like this,
you are warned.
